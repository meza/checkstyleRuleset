{"name":"Checkstyleruleset","tagline":"","body":"### The style of the output should identify the team, not the individuals.\r\n\r\nI have been working on various projects, where we introduced some sort of common coding standards.\r\nThe buy in from the developers is usually low, and they get frustrated by the constraints. On a legacy codebase, introducing such rules usually results in thousands of violations from the start, which people have to work through. Not to mention when the build breaks because of a silly checkstyle mistake.\r\nTo ease the pain, I usually provide an IDE setup with the rule set, so most of the fixes could happen magically, without even bothering the programmer. This results in less frustration, and only major violations, which indeed should break the build.\r\n\r\nTo use my pretty strict rule set, use\r\n```\r\n    <build>\r\n        <plugins>\r\n            <plugin>\r\n                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n                <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>\r\n                <version>2.10</version>\r\n                <dependencies>\r\n                    <dependency>\r\n                        <groupId>hu.meza.tools</groupId>\r\n                        <artifactId>checkstyle</artifactId>\r\n                        <version>0.1</version>\r\n                    </dependency>\r\n                </dependencies>\r\n                <configuration>\r\n                    <configLocation>checkstyle.xml</configLocation>\r\n                    <consoleOutput>true</consoleOutput>\r\n                </configuration>\r\n                <executions>\r\n                    <execution>\r\n                        <goals>\r\n                            <goal>check</goal>\r\n                        </goals>\r\n                        <phase>verify</phase>\r\n                    </execution>\r\n                </executions>\r\n            </plugin>\r\n        </plugins>\r\n    </build>\r\n    <reporting>\r\n        <plugins>\r\n            <plugin>\r\n                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n                <artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>\r\n                <version>2.10</version>\r\n                <configuration>\r\n                    <configLocation>checkstyle.xml</configLocation>\r\n                </configuration>\r\n            </plugin>\r\n        </plugins>\r\n    </reporting>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will download the maven dependency, set the rules and run mvn checkstyle:check with the build.\r\n\r\n### IntelliJ IDEA Setup\r\n1. Download CheckStyle-IDEA plugin\r\n2. Add https://github.com/meza/checkstyleRuleset/blob/master/src/main/resources/checkstyle.xml as a HTTP ruleset\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
